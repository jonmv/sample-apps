# Vespa sample applications

## Featured sample applications
### album-recommendation
This is the intro application to Vespa. Learn how to configure the schema for simple recommendation and search use cases in [album-recommendation](album-recommendation). [album-recommendation-java](album-recommendation-java) is an introduction for how to integrate Java code to process data and queries.

### blog-recommendation
This set of sample apps goes deeper. Starting with [blog-search](blog-search), a more complex search app is build. Then transform this into an app for making recommendations in [blog-recommendation](blog-recommendation). Finally, use machine learning to train and use a model for use in recommendations.

### use-case-shopping
Create an end-to-end E-Commerce shopping engine using [use-case-shopping](use-case-shopping) and an [Amazon product data set](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html).

### text-search
[text-search](text-search) dives deep into text ranking, using Vespa's _nativerank_ and BM25 implementations. It uses the [MS Marco](http://www.msmarco.org/) dataset.

### semantic-qa-retrieval
[semantic-qa-retrieval](semantic-qa-retrieval) takes text search to the next level using the [Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), text embeeddings and [tensor ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/tensor.html). This sample app demonstrates how to return answers to questions.


## Detailed sample applications
[model-evaluation](model-evaluation): A sample Vespa application which demonstrates Stateless ML Model Evaluation.

[boolean-search](boolean-search): Learn how to use prediate fields to implement boolean indexing. I.e. how to express in a document a range of values to match, like _"this fits readers in age range 20 to 30"_.

[multiple-bundles](multiple-bundles): Build a Java application using components and dependencies in other bundles (jars). 

basic-search-*: Simple application that can be deployed in different environments

[part-purchases-demo](part-purchases-demo): A sample Vespa application to assist with with learning how to group according to the [Grouping Guide](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/grouping.html).

This repository has a set of Vespa sample applications.
Most of the applications are written for [Vespa Cloud](http://cloud.vespa.ai).
To deploy to a self-hosted, follow steps below -
refer to [album-recommendation-selfhosted](album-recommendation-selfhosted) for a working example

1.  Modify _nodes_ element in services.xml, replace _count_ with _node_ elements:
    ```
    <nodes count="1" />
    
    <nodes>
        <node hostalias="node1" distribution-key="0" />
    </nodes>
    ```

1.  Add _hosts.xml_

1.  Remove _<client-authorize />_ in services.xml. 

----

Note: Applications with pom.xml must be built before being deployed.
