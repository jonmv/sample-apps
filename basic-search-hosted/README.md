# Hosted Vespa sample applications â€” Basic hosted stateless Vespa application

This application demonstrates how to set up and run a basic hosted Vespa application,
and is intended as an introduction to both Vespa and the hosted Vespa service. <!-- TODO LINK -->  

Included are detailed functional tests for the Vespa application, written in JUnit. While the
main intention for such functional tests is to run them in the hosted Vespa continuous
deployment pipeline, <!-- TODO LINK --> to verify changes to the Vespa application before
they are deployed to the production environments, these particular tests also

* demonstrate how to communicate with the Vespa deployment over HTTP,
* serve as introductory documentation for the most central of Vespa's features, and
* provide a starting point for thorough functional tests of your own Vespa application.

The tests require a running Vespa deployment, which is easily obtained in hosted Vespa's
`dev` environment. <!-- TODO LINK --> It is also possible to run the tests against a local
Vespa deployment running with, e.g., docker, as in the other [sample apps](../). 

## <div style="{color: red;}">This is work in progress, and the hosted service this application refers to is not yet 
publicy available. The next items are therefore irrelevant for now.</div>

## Sign up in hosted Vespa console, and create an application with the wanted name

## Generate and upload key pair
Install `openssl` and run
<pre>
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem
openssl ec -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
</pre>
to generate a private and public key. Then upload the public key through the hosted Vespa dashboard.

## Configure pom.xml for your hosted Vespa application
Set the `tenant`, `application`, and `privateKeyFile` properties in `pom.xml`.

## Deploy to dev and test against it
Command to build and deploy application to the hosted development environment is
<pre>
mvn clean package vespa:deploy 
</pre>
Example System, Staging and Production tests can then be run from an IDE without further setup.
<!-- ... or, add a description for users with older than IntelliJ 2012, and Eclipse ... ??? -->

## Set up a CI job which deploys your application
Command to build and submit application to the hosted Vespa API is
<pre>
mvn vespa:compileVersion # Stores the version to compile against in target/vespa.compile.version
mvn -P fat-test-application \
-Dvespaversion="$(cat target/vespa.compile.version)" \
-DauthorEmail=<span style="{background-color: yellow;}">user@domain</span> \
clean package vespa:submit 
</pre>

## Local development

<!-- TODO: Un-comment the below warning -->
<!-- em>This only works with self-hosted `services.xml` and `hosts.xml`, which can be found in any of the other sample apps.</em -->

### Run those JUnit tests against the local docker container
Assuming the below is done, put
<pre>
{
  "application": "this:is:ignored",
  "zone": "dev.local",
  "system": "publiccd",
  "zoneEndpoints": {
    "dev.local": {
      "container": "http://localhost:8080/"
    }
  }
}
</pre>
in some file `/path/to/test/config`, and run JUnit tests with `-Dvespa.test.config=/path/to/test/config -Psystem-tests`
to run all `@SystemTest` classes. `-Pstaging-tests` and `-Pproduction-tests` runs the other suites of tests. 

### Executable example
**Check-out, compile and run:**
<pre data-test="exec">
$ git clone https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps.git
$ export VESPA_SAMPLE_APPS=`pwd`/sample-apps
$ cd $VESPA_SAMPLE_APPS/basic-search-hosted &amp;&amp; mvn clean package
$ docker run --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-container --privileged \
  --volume $VESPA_SAMPLE_APPS:/vespa-sample-apps --publish 8080:8080 vespaengine/vespa
</pre>

**Wait for the configserver to start:**
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ docker exec vespa bash -c 'curl -s --head http://localhost:19071/ApplicationStatus'
</pre>

**Deploy the application:**
<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-deploy prepare /vespa-sample-apps/basic-search-hosted/target/application.zip && \
  /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-deploy activate'
</pre>

**Wait for the application to start:**
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ curl -s --head http://localhost:8080/ApplicationStatus
</pre>

**Test the application:**
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains='"totalCount": 0'>
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/search/?query=name:foo
</pre>

**Shutdown and remove the container:**
<pre data-test="after">
$ docker rm -f vespa
</pre>
